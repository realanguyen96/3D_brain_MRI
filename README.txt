This is a group project by 4 students from DANA 4830 course of Data Analytics program in Langara College.

We attempted to replicate a study in Nature Comm by Vogelstein et al. (2021)

My contribution was RandomProjection (RP) and 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for 3D brain MRI classification (0 = control, 1 = ASD) and overall troubleshooting/proof-reading

Datasets were downloaded from https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_II.html and transformed into numpy array but the original data was too heavy for GitHub, it won't be uploaded here
